Full-stack developer with over 7 years of experience in a variety of technologies. Professionally, I work with Java, React, AWS, and PostgreSQL, but my expertise doesn't stop there. I also occassionally work in Flutter and other saas offerings along with various NoSQL databases, always eager to explore new tools and technologies.

I'm passionate about continuous learning and not limiting myself to a specific tech stack. Whether it's building scalable backend systems or creating front-end interfaces.

On this blog, I share my journey, the tools I love, the challenges I face, and everything tech-related that I come across.
